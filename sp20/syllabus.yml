    description: Data Science is grounded in statistics, and to make sense of your data before predicting with any model requires some statistical analysis and lots of charts. A significant portion of your time and resources are spent on data preparation and clearning, not model building. How do we clean data? How do we make meaningful observations? How can you create graphs that represent data trends? Answers to these questions are highly sought after in all computationally-driven fields, so learning the basics here is a great start to your future in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science!
